# Medical-Image-Annotation-Job

Your goal, as a product owner is to build a product that helps doctors quickly identify cases of pneumonia in children. You'll want to build a classification system that
* Can help flag serious cases
* Quickly identify healthy cases
* And, generally, act as a diagnostic aid for doctors

As such, this project is designed to test your ability to build a labeled dataset that distinguishes between healthy and pneumonia x-ray images; this can be used by ML engineers later on down the line to build a classification product. Your main task will be to create a data labeling job using [Appen's platform](https://client.appen.com/jobs).

### The Data
The dataset you'll be given is a modified version of this [Kaggle chest x-ray dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia), with most labels removed. Every piece of data is a chest x-ray image. You may see images taken that are slightly different in size and taken under slightly different exposure times. A typical, labeled image is shown below.
